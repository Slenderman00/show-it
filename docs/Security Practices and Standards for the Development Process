Security Practices and Standards for the Development Process 
 
Introduction 
 
This document outlines the security practices and standards to guide the development of our new solution, which must: 
 - Display videos, images, and text. 
 - Edit display duration for each post. 
 - Easily add content from mobile and PC. 
 - Archive expired content for potential future use. 
 - Allow an admin (or possibly all users) to edit others' content. 
 
 The solution is designed to share important information on an office screen. 
 

Security Principles 

 
Confidentiality 
 	- Protect all sensitive information from unauthorized access. 
 Integrity 
  -	 Ensure systems and data are protected from unauthorized changes or deletion. 
 Availability 
  - 	Make sure the system is accessible to authorized users when needed. 
 
 Security Practices 
 Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC) 
  	- Integrate security into all phases of development: 
    		- Requirements Phase 
      			- Identify and document security requirements. 
     			 - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR). 
    	- Design Phase 
   		   - Perform threat modeling and security design reviews. 
   		- Design system architecture with security in mind, including data encryption 		and secure communication channels. 
 	   - Implementation Phase 
   		   - Follow secure coding standards and practices (e.g., OWASP). 
  		    - Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. 
   		   - Use libraries and frameworks with known security practices. 
  	  - Testing 
 		     - Conduct static and dynamic security testing (e.g., SAST, DAST). 
   		   - Test access controls, data integrity, and system resilience against 	attacks. 
   		   - Perform code reviews with a focus on security vulnerabilities. 

 
    Deployment 
      - Secure the deployment environment and test for security vulnerabilities. 
      - Implement secure update mechanisms. 
      - Ensure proper configuration management and use of secure deployment pipelines. 

 
   Maintenance 
      - Continuously monitor security and apply updates regularly. 
      - Perform regular security audits and vulnerability assessments. 
      - Establish an incident response plan and update it as needed. 
 
 Security Architecture 
  - Implement layered security (Defense-in-Depth). 
  - Use the principle of least privilege for access control. 
  - Encrypt data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest. 
  - Ensure secure configuration of all components and services. 
 
 Coding Standards 
  - Follow established secure coding standards like OWASP. 
  - Regularly conduct security-focused code reviews. 
  - Use static code analysis tools to find vulnerabilities. 
  - Ensure proper input validation and output encoding to prevent injection attacks. 
 
 Vulnerability Management 
  - Regularly perform security scans and penetration testing. 
  - Implement a process to prioritize and fix vulnerabilities. 
  - Keep the system updated with security patches. 
  - Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all software components and their vulnerabilities. 
 
 Security Awareness 
  - Provide regular security training for the development team. 
  - Keep developers informed about current security threats and best practices. 
  - Promote a security-first culture within the organization. 
 
 Standards 
 Authentication and Authorization 
  - Use strong authentication mechanisms like multi-factor authentication (MFA). 
  - Implement robust authorization controls based on roles and needs. 
  - Regularly review and update access control policies. 
 
 Logging and Monitoring 
  - Implement comprehensive logging of security events and activities. 
  - Continuously monitor systems for suspicious activity. 
  - Use SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools to analyze logs and detect anomalies. 
 
 Security Assessments 
  - Regularly conduct security audits and assessments. 
  - Perform risk analyses to identify and mitigate potential security risks. 
  - Use third-party security assessments for unbiased evaluations. 
 
 Incident Response 
  - Develop and maintain an incident response plan. 
  - Regularly test and improve the incident response process. 
  - Ensure clear communication channels and responsibilities during an incident. 
 
 Compliance 
 
- Ensure the development process and solution comply with relevant laws and regulations. 
 - Follow industry standards and guidelines, such as ISO 27001 and GDPR. 
 - Regularly review compliance requirements and update practices accordingly. 
 
Conclusion 
 
By following these security practices and standards, we ensure our new solution is developed with high security standards, protecting our organization and users from potential threats. This fosters trust and ensures a reliable platform for sharing information in the office.
